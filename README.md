# SmartAmbulance
This is made by Vinit Sonagara(myself) and Anirudh Pandey.
Smart Ambulance System Using ArduinoMega 2560 and RFID sensors.
The main idea here is to add fourth light which can be of any colour to the existing system.So when ambulance passes one signal the fourth light will be on at the next signal so the nearby people can understand that the ambulance is going to come in few minutes.
